# Resume Generator

![](./assets/demo.gif)

Super simple Rust-based resume generator that produces LaTeX resumes as PDFs. Provides a simple, quick way to update resume information and generate a new PDF to use.

The project uses templates and JSON data to generate the resumes. The workflow is containerized with Docker to ensure consistent builds across systems.

Serves primarily as a introductory learning project for Rust.
